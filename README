The main point of this software is to generate code for animation effects with LEDs. Suggested code outputs include:
- C code for AVR using TLC5940
- C code for PIC using TLC5940
- Processing code for Arduino using TLC5940

The project involves modular LED boards using either the TLC5940 LED driver chip, or similar chips. These chips use serial data to drive LEDs, and offer features like PWM and grayscale for each LED.

Modules are generally a printed circuit board with an LED driver, connectors, and LEDs (though it might only contain headers for external LEDs). Modules can be daisy-chained to allow for large displays of many LEDs.

Users will be able to draw and use modules. Users should also be able to draw and define a module as a component to be used in other modules. This includes things like commercial connectors, headers, LEDs (5mm, 3mm, rectangle, etc). They should also be able to define how these components are connected together.

When a module is defined to be an LED, it's fill_on_color property will be present (see mod_define.xml for initial design specs). If using the TLC5940, or other similar drivers with grayscale capability, use variations from fill_color to fill_on_color. fill_on_color should always be a primary color to ensure proper emulation of grayscaled colors.

User should be able to create a single animation, multiple animations or small loops, or a sequential animation A sequential animation involves the user selecting one or more LEDs in the project, and then performing one of a variety of actions Either turning on and off each led in sequence, turning on each led in sequence, etc

If a module is an LED, it should have two or more [connection] points. If more than two connection points, it should also have wires as needed.

Modules and Projects are saved as XML files. module.xsd is the schema definition for modules, and project.xsd is the schema definition for project files.

Questions:
How to deal with RGB LEDs? Semi-recursive modules? How difficult is this? How many layers of modules can I allow, and how much complexity will this add?
